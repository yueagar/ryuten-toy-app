ok - make a react native app 
single page
contains a list of all the ryuten servers
each list item has the server region, mode, total players and alive players count
fetch the data on a regular interval
follow whatever best practices u can find online and try to reduce the component re-rendering as much as possible
use expo to setup everything
and zustand as your store
to store the server data

design is on you - dont matter that much since we have a ui designer on team but yeah sometimes you need you use ur own design skills for small stuff
